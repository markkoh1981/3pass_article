**EXCLUSIVE: Rare High-End Michael Jordan Basketball Cards Uncovered in Arizona Shoe Boxes**

A remarkable discovery has sent shockwaves through the sports card community, as a rare collection of over 500 Michael Jordan basketball cards has surfaced from shoe boxes located inside a home in Tucson, Arizona. The astonishing find is valued in the six-figure range and will be sold by auction.

The collection was inherited by a man who had inherited his brother's rare sports card collection. According to Ryan Jones, Director of Marketing & Public Relations at Auction Monthly, "We are thrilled to announce the discovery of this extraordinary basketball card collection. The sheer volume of high-grade Michael Jordan cards, coupled with the inclusion of rare inserts and cards from other basketball legends like Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, makes this a once-in-a-generation find."

The collection is the result of an Arizona collector's dedication to acquiring every Michael Jordan refractor card produced from the 1990s to early 2000s. The collector's mission was to collect nearly every Jordan refractor and atomic refractor across various brands from 1993 to Jordan's final years with the Washington Wizards.

The highlight of this amazing basketball card collection is the impressive selection of rare insert cards, including precious metal gems, star rubies, and ultra gold stars. Some of the notable finds include:

* Two of only 50 ever produced 2001 Topps Chrome Black Refractors
* A 1996 Flair Showcase Row O Legacy Collection /150
* A 1997 Skybox e-x2001 Jambalaya multiple east-west Michael Jordan / Kobe Bryant refactors
* Ultra Power Supreme 1996 Topps Chrome and 1998 Topps Chrome Preview Jordan refractors

The collection is currently undergoing professional grading, with several cards sent to PSA for grading. Many of the cards will be made available to the public at www.auctionmonthly.com.

"We're excited to offer this incredible collection to the public," says Jones. "Collectors can expect regular updates and insights on this extraordinary find through our social media channels."
