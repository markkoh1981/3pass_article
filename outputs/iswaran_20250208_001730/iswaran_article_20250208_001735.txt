**Title:** "Iswaran's Home Detention: A New Era in Sentencing in Singapore"

As Singapore's first cabinet minister to be imprisoned, Iswaran's case has sparked widespread interest in the country's judicial system. In a recent development, the former Transport Minister has been placed on a home detention scheme, marking a significant shift in sentencing practices.

According to the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), Iswaran will serve his remaining sentence at home under specified conditions. This includes curfew monitoring using an electronic monitoring tag, being gainfully occupied either in work, study, or training, and reporting to the SPS for counselling. The aim of this scheme is to encourage good behaviour among inmates, allowing them to reintegrate into society upon release.

Inmates placed on home detention can serve their remaining sentences at their residences under strict conditions. However, those who display exceptional behaviour in prison may be eligible for early release. For example, Iswaran's sentence could have been significantly shorter if he had shown good behaviour from the start. "It is appropriate to impose a sentence in excess of both parties' positions," said Justice Vincent Hoong when delivering his decision.

The government has taken a proactive stance in addressing corruption, with 13 individuals prosecuted for receiving gifts as public servants. Iswaran's case serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of upholding high standards within the civil service and government.

Former Attorney-General Walter Woon noted that the sentencing has "clear signalling effects." This means that the verdict is sending a strong message to the public about the need for integrity and transparency in government. As Singapore continues to evolve its judicial system, it's clear that home detention schemes will play a key role in promoting accountability and rehabilitation.

In Iswaran's case, serving two-thirds of his sentence could lead to early release on remission orders. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such schemes in reducing recidivism rates and promoting successful reintegration into society.

"The civil service and the government must be clean and that it must be seen as clean," said Justice Vincent Hoong. This commitment to integrity will be crucial in maintaining public trust and ensuring that Singapore's justice system remains a benchmark for regional and global standards.

As Iswaran begins his home detention, it's clear that his case is more than just a personal issue â€“ it's also about promoting accountability, transparency, and the need for good governance.
