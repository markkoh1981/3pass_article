**Summary:**

The article reports on a surge in the price of BNB Chain tokens, including $BNB, which has seen a +10% increase in the last 24 hours. The reason for this surge is attributed to the launch of a test token on the BNB Chain Meme Launchpad, which was created by the BNB Chain team for a tutorial video. Traders have been buying into the token, causing its market cap to rise significantly before crashing back down.
