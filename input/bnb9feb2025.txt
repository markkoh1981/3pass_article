"Bnb chain tokens are pumping including $BNB for CZ (Founder and Former Binance CEO)
Reason behind the pump is, a test token was launched for testing BNB Chain meme launchpad. Community members are buying it which is getting big traction. 

Hence the liquidity is coming to BNB Chain.

"Traders pumped a test token created by the BNB Chain team for a tutorial video to a market cap of over $35 million before crashing down to a market cap of around $15 million at the time of the writing.

The token was created for a step-by-step video walkthrough of creating a memecoin on the Four.Meme platform, a launchpad for social tokens on BNB Chain.

According to an X post from Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the name of the memecoin was revealed during a single frame on the training video, which was removed by a BNB Chain member upon discovering the issue.

However, the Binance founder told the team member to put the video back up. At the time of CZ’s X post, the market cap of the TST token was around $494,000.

CZ also made it clear that his post was not an endorsement of the token and that it “is NOT an official token by the BNB Chain team, or anyone. It is a test token used just for that video tutorial. Nothing more.”

The memecoin’s meteoric rise and price volatility highlight the rabid popularity of the niche asset class, which has come under scrutiny from financial regulators and US lawmakers in recent weeks."
